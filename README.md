PS5 NOR Decode
Overview
This Python script extracts the DBI contents from specified offsets, formats the extracted data into an EMC_LOG.txt file, and decodes it into human-readable text. The script uses wildcards and is useful for debugging a PlayStation 5, especially when UART access is unavailable.

Features
Extracts DBI contents from specified start and end offsets.

Formats extracted data into EMC_LOG.txt.

Decodes data into human-readable text.

Utilizes wildcards for data extraction.

Supports PlayStation 5 debugging without UART access.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Required Python libraries (install using requirements.txt if provided)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/apewalkers/PS5_NOR_Decode.git
cd PS5_NOR_Decode

Run the script:

The extracted and formatted data will be saved in EMC_LOG.txt.

Script Details
The script performs the following steps:

Reads the binary data from the specified offsets.

Extracts the DBI contents using wildcards.

Formats the extracted data into EMC_LOG.txt.

Decodes the data into human-readable text.
